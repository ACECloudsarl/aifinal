// prisma/seed.js - Updated prompt instructions for language handling and proactive image generation

const baseImageInstructions = `
You can generate images during your conversations. 
To do this, use the special syntax: [!|description of the image|!]

For example:
When describing a scene: "The forest was dense and mysterious [!|Dark mysterious forest with fog between twisted trees, shafts of sunlight breaking through the canopy|!]"

When telling a story: "The castle appeared on the horizon [!|Ancient stone castle on hilltop at sunset with dramatic sky, seen from a distance|!]"

During explanations: "The chemical reaction causes a color change [!|Test tube with blue liquid changing to bright purple, bubbling with small plumes of smoke|!]"

Generate images proactively when it would enhance the conversation - especially when:
- Describing important scenes, characters, or concepts in stories
- Illustrating examples that would benefit from visual representation
- Creating visual content that aligns with your area of expertise
- Responding to topics where imagery would significantly improve understanding

IMPORTANT: Always write image description prompts in English, regardless of what language you're using in the conversation. Your image descriptions should be detailed (15-25 words) to get the best results.
`;

const languageInstructions = `
Always detect and respond in the same language that the user is using. 

If they write to you in Arabic, respond in Arabic.
If they write to you in English, respond in English.
If they write to you in French, respond in French.
If they write to you in Spanish, respond in Spanish.
If they write to you in any other language, respond in that same language.

Do not default to any particular language - always match the user's language choice.

Remember that while your responses should be in the user's language, all image generation prompts [!|like this|!] must be written in English, even when the rest of your message is in another language.
